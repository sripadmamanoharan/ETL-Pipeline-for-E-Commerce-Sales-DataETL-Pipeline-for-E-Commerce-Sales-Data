# ETL-Pipeline-for-E-Commerce-Sales-DataETL-Pipeline-for-E-Commerce-Sales-Data

This project involves building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process raw e-commerce sales data into a structured format suitable for analytics. The pipeline extracts data, applies necessary transformations, and loads it into a data warehouse, facilitating insightful analyses of sales, revenue, and customer trends.

Key Objectives
Extract raw e-commerce sales data from source systems.
Transform the data by cleaning, aggregating, and structuring it for analysis.
Load the transformed data into a data warehouse or analytics platform.
Analyze the data to derive key metrics and insights.
Skills Demonstrated
Data Engineering: Designing and implementing data pipelines.
Data Analytics: Interpreting and analyzing processed data to extract insights.
SQL: Utilizing Structured Query Language for data manipulation and querying.
Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas): For data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
SQL: To perform aggregations and analytics on the transformed data.
Apache Airflow: For orchestrating and managing the ETL pipeline.
AWS Redshift or Google BigQuery: As the data warehouse for storing processed data.
Power BI/Tableau: For building reports and dashboards to visualize key metrics.
Implementation Steps
1. Data Extraction
Begin by extracting raw sales data from e-commerce platforms, which may include order details, customer information, and product data. This data could be in various formats such as CSV files, JSON, or database records.

2. Data Transformation
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, correct inconsistencies, and remove duplicates.
Aggregation: Summarize data to compute total sales, revenue, and other pertinent metrics.
Feature Engineering: Create new features like TotalAmount by multiplying Quantity and UnitPrice.
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Example transformation: Creating 'TotalAmount'
df['TotalAmount'] = df['Quantity'] * df['UnitPrice']
3. Data Loading
Load the transformed data into a data warehouse such as AWS Redshift or Google BigQuery. This step may involve:

Establishing a connection to the data warehouse.
Creating necessary tables and schemas.
Inserting or updating records with the transformed data.
4. Data Analysis and Reporting
Utilize SQL and visualization tools to analyze the loaded data:

SQL Queries: Retrieve data to identify trends, such as top-selling products or customer purchasing patterns.
Dashboards: Develop interactive dashboards using Power BI or Tableau to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs).
Getting Started
To replicate this project:

Set Up the Environment: Ensure Python, Apache Airflow, and your chosen data warehouse (AWS Redshift or Google BigQuery) are installed and configured.
Develop the ETL Pipeline:
Define Data Sources: Specify paths to raw data files or database connections.
Implement Transformation Logic: Write scripts to clean and aggregate data.
Schedule and Monitor: Use Apache Airflow to schedule ETL tasks and monitor their execution.
Conclusion
Building an ETL pipeline for e-commerce sales data streamlines the process of converting raw data into actionable insights. This project demonstrates the integration of data engineering and analytics to support informed business decisions.
